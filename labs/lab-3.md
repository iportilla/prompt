Department of Applied Mathematics
Colloquium and Weekly Seminars
Week of Nov. 3rd – Nov. 7th
 
 
Nonlinear Waves Seminar
 
SPEAKER: Shashwat Sharan, Department of Applied Mathematics, University of California Merced
TITLE: Vacuum dambreak of a superfluid: Rarefaction waves in a harmonic potential
TIME: 4:00 PM, Wednesday, 5 October 2025
PLACE: ECOT 317 and https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/94503784618
 
When a barrier confining a fluid is suddenly removed, a rarefaction wave (RW) emerges. We study its quantum analogue: a vacuum dam-break in a quasi-1D Bose-Einstein condensate confined by a harmonic potential and described by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The harmonic trap breaks the self-similar structure of the classical problem, making analytic treatment non-trivial. Using a perturbative framework, we derive an exact RW solution of the trapped system that captures the essential dynamics and reveals a finite-time singularity in the density gradient. This approach is also applicable to other related fluid flow models, such as the Burgers equation. Theoretical predictions show excellent agreement with direct simulations and experimental observations.
 
 
Mathematical Biology Seminar

TITLE: Bridging neural dynamics across scales: from single neurons to networks
TIME: 11:00 AM, Thursday, 6 October 2025
PLACE: ECCR 257
 
The brain is a complex system which can be modeled at multiple scales—fom molecules, to neurons (which are cells that can communicate with one another through electrical currents), to networks of neurons connected via synapses.
 
Notably, contemporary work often uses rate models—implemented as systems of nonlinear ODEs governing interacting units—whose convenient mathematical description enables researchers to leverage recent machine-learning advances. These rate models can be related to processed brain recordings where the neural responses are combined across single neurons (for instance through averaging over a specific group of neurons or through Principal Component Analysis). Yet, most single neurons in the human brain communicate via all-or-none signals called spikes that are triggered in response to the electrical input they receive through incoming synapses. In consequence, a principled link from spiking single neuron descriptions to population rate dynamics is essential. Along these lines, previous work has related the average firing probability in a population of simplified spiking neuron models to rate dynamics. However, challenges remain to account for complex temporal dependencies in the biological single neuron response and for the heterogeneity of synaptic input across the population.
 
I will present a theoretical reduction that derives approximate dynamic rate equations from spiking neuron models endowed with biologically plausible, multi-timescale adaptation— features that allow these models to quantitatively capture spiking responses from recorded single neurons in specific contexts. The resulting rate dynamics explicitly capture how heterogeneous and time-varying synaptic inputs shape firing probability over time, going beyond existing approaches.
 
If time permits, I will also present ongoing work that leverages mathematically convenient rate dynamics to understand how mesoscale architectural constraints shape the response of properties of large and structured neural networks. Specifically, we focus on a peculiar feature of several brain regions: the absence of recurrent excitatory connections, and ask what consequences this entails for the dynamics of these networks.

TITLE: Flexible and Efficient Spatial Extremes Estimation and Emulation via Variational Autoencoders
TIME: 3:35 PM, Thursday, 6 October 2025
PLACE: ECCR 245
 
The world is full of extreme events.  For example, a central question in public health planning might be to assess the likelihood of extreme exposures (meteorological conditions, air pollution, social stress, etc.).  Such extreme events typically occur in spatial and/or temporal clusters.  Yet, the principal methodologies that statisticians deal with spatially dependent processes (Gaussian processes and Markov random fields) are not suitable for complex tail dependence structures. This is particularly true of simulation model emulation.  More flexible spatial extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. Here I present recent work where we develop a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and non-stationary dependence properties, and we integrate it in the encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder (XVAE), whose parameters are estimated via variational Bayes combined with deep learning. The XVAE can be used to analyze high-dimensional data or as a spatio-temporal emulator that characterizes the distribution of potential mechanistic model output states and produces outputs that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the tail. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than traditional Bayesian inference while also outperforming many spatial extremes models with a stationary dependence structure.  We demonstrate our method applied to a high-resolution satellite-derived dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea and to a high-resolution simulation model of a turbulent plume, such as one would find in a wildfire.  We note, however, that these methods can be applied to any data set or simulation model that exhibits extremes.
