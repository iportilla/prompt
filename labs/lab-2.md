Subject: Frustration with Delayed Shipments

Dear Company Support Team,

I’m reaching out to express my frustration regarding the recent delays in our shipments. This has caused significant disruption to our operations and has put us in a difficult position with our clients.

We chose your services based on your reputation for reliability, but these delays are becoming a recurring issue. If this isn’t resolved quickly, we may be forced to explore alternative vendors.
Please let me know how you plan to address this immediately.

Sincerely,

Melissa Hart 
Operations Manager
